#[[##]]# Finder

A [```Finder```](apidocs/Finder) is a **factory for creating a query that extracts results from a data source**: for instance a query on a registry
of persons to get some records according to certain **criteria**. The data source can be in-memory or a more sophisticated entity such a database. ```Finder``` has
been designed with these main purposes:

1. To provide a **fluent** and **extensible** API to **declutter** the exposed methods.
2. To possibly **cooperate with the data source and optimize the query**, for speed and memory (minimizing the amount of data to bring in memory).
3. To provide a design pattern in which the parameters that drive the search can be **composed in different parts of the application**; for instance, code in
the presentation tier might rely upon a half-baked query provided in the business tier and specify additional criteria (sorting, filtering, pagination).
4. To provide a decoupling abstraction from the implementation of the data source.

![UML](apidocs/it/tidalwave/util/Finder.svg)


```Finder```'s methods can be either **intermediate** or **termination**:

+ *intermediate* methods are presumed to work in a **chained style**, so they always return a ```Finder``` (even though not the same instance, since a ```Finder```
**must be immutable**). They are used to set a number of parameter of the query **before the query is executed**.
+ *termination* methods are invoked when all parameters are set and they **actually perform the query** and retrieve results.

For instance the intermediate methods shown below can be used to specify which section of the results we are interested into:

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=from|file=${project.basedir}/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/util/Finder.java} -->
<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=max|file=${project.basedir}/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/util/Finder.java} -->

The termination methods shown below, instead, perform the query, retrieve objects or provide a count of them:

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=optionalResult|file=${project.basedir}/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/util/Finder.java} -->
<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=optionalFirstResult|file=${project.basedir}/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/util/Finder.java} -->
<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=results|file=${project.basedir}/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/util/Finder.java} -->
<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=count|file=${project.basedir}/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/util/Finder.java} -->

*Note: at present time, there are some deprecated methods that were designed before Java 8 ```Optional```  was available; their signature declares a
```NotFoundException```, which is a checked exception. They should not be used for new development as they will be removed in a future release.*

For the following examples of ```Finder``` usage we will make reference to a registry of ```Person```s that exposes a method to query the contained records:

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=finder|file=${project.basedir}/../../modules/examples/Data/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/thesefoolishthings/examples/person/PersonRegistry.java} -->

Data can be queried as:

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=basic-example|file=${project.basedir}/../../modules/examples/FinderExample1/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/thesefoolishthings/examples/finderexample1/Main.java} -->

They can be sorted in some basic way:

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=sort-example|file=${project.basedir}/../../modules/examples/FinderExample1/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/thesefoolishthings/examples/finderexample1/Main.java} -->

Intermediate methods can be freely mixed. This first example shows the utility of ```Finder``` to offer a clean API that doesn't
inflate with lots of methods only to provide variants of the query (it's the typical advantage of a fluent interface). It will be shown that this API can
be extended with new methods without changing the general concepts.


#[[###]]# In-memory ```Finder```s

```Finder```s can operate both in memory and with other data source. Their core scenario is the latter, otherwise they could be replaced by Java 8 ```Stream```
(a more detailed comparison with ```Stream```s is at the end of this chapter); but to start with simpler code, let's start with the in-memory approach.

If the whole collection of objects to query is already in memory, a predefined wrapping ```Finder``` can be created with the factory method ```ofCloned()```;
it is used by a first example implementation of ```PersonRegistry```:

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=ofCloned|file=${project.basedir}/../../modules/examples/FinderExample1/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/thesefoolishthings/examples/finderexample1/InMemoryPersonRegistry.java} -->

As the name says, the collection is cloned (shallow clone) at construction time, so any change made after the ```Finder``` creation won't be seen.

In-memory ```Finder```s can be useful in some real-world cases, for instance when a controller or a DAO has cached data, or to create mocks when testing classes
that use more complex ```Finder```s.



#[[###]]# Data source ```Finder```s

Now we can have a look on how a Finder can work with a data source that is not in memory. A classic example is the relational database, so we will use JPA
(Java Persistence API) as a reference. Of course similar examples could be made with other APIs for relational database as well as with other kinds of
data sources, such as NoSQL databases, semantic databases, etc.

The central class of JPA is ```EntityManager```: it's the facility that makes it possible to create and execute queries. What we want is to have the
```Finder``` to execute for us code such as:

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=createQuery|file=${project.basedir}/../../modules/examples/JPAFinderExample/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/thesefoolishthings/examples/jpafinderexample/impl/JpaPersonFinder.java} -->

where ```jpaql```, ```firstResult``` and ```maxResults``` have been properly set by intermediate methods previously called. In other words, if we had a test
for our finder we would like to have this kind of behaviour:

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=tests|file=${project.basedir}/../../modules/examples/JPAFinderExample/src/test/java/it/tidalwave/thesefoolishthings/examples/jpafinderexample/impl/JpaPersonFinderTest.java} -->

The first thing we need is to define the state of the ```Finder```, which must both model the parameters set by intermediate methods and contain a reference
to the data source.

TXMANAGER

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=fields|file=${project.basedir}/../../modules/examples/JPAFinderExample/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/thesefoolishthings/examples/jpafinderexample/impl/JpaPersonFinder.java} -->

Let's now focus on the implementation of intermediate methods. They usually don't do anything smart, but just accumulate the required parameters for later
performing the query. Since a ```Finder``` must be immutable, they can't change the internal state: they rather must **create and return a cloned ```Finder```**
with the original state and only a single field changed. This is a typical approach for immutable objects.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=intermediate-methods|file=${project.basedir}/../../modules/examples/JPAFinderExample/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/thesefoolishthings/examples/jpafinderexample/impl/JpaPersonFinder.java} -->

Now let's deal with sorting. Sorting works in a different way in function of the ```Finder``` being “in memory” or associated to a data source:

+ **in-memory** happens by means of the sorting features of the Java Collection API, so there's nothing special about it; but it is to be pointed out
that it is performed **before** pagination (as it should), so it's quite different calling a Finder with from()/max() -then calling results() -then sorting
and sorting with the intermediate methods of Finder.
+ **in the data source**, which allows to optimize the query (if the data source cooperates).

In both cases sorting criteria are defined by means of the interfaces ```SortCriterion``` and ```InMemorySortCriterion```, which extends the former.
```InMemorySortCriterion``` declares a method which will be called by the ```Finder``` to perform the sort.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=sort|file=${project.basedir}/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/util/Finder.java} -->

A convenience method ```of()``` makes it possible to easily create a working ```SortCriterion``` by wrapping a ```Comparator```:

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=sort-criteria|file=${project.basedir}/../../modules/examples/FinderExample1/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/thesefoolishthings/examples/finderexample1/PersonSortCriteria.java} -->

Things are more interesting in case of data-source sorting. The implementation varies from case to case, but in general the relevant intermediate method just
behaves as other intermediate methods and just collects the information for a later use:

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=sort-method|file=${project.basedir}/../../modules/examples/JPAFinderExample/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/thesefoolishthings/examples/jpafinderexample/impl/JpaPersonFinder.java} -->

A good implementation of SortCriterion provides by itself the behaviour, which in case of JPA is to provide the ```ORDER BY``` section of the query:

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=sort-criterion|file=${project.basedir}/../../modules/examples/JPAFinderExample/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/thesefoolishthings/examples/jpafinderexample/impl/JpaPersonFinder.java} -->

The core part of the finder is the method which computes and executes the query. It basically appends to the half-backed JPAQL query the needed ```ORDER BY```
clauses, delegating the job to the implementations of ```SortCriterion``` that we have seen above.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=createQueryFull|file=${project.basedir}/../../modules/examples/JPAFinderExample/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/thesefoolishthings/examples/jpafinderexample/impl/JpaPersonFinder.java} -->

Now we can implement termination methods: they just create the query, extract the part of the results they need and convert the data from a JPA entity to the
desired class (this task may be needed or not in function of the architecture of the application: a ```Finder``` might expose JPA entities if desired).

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=termination-methods|file=${project.basedir}/../../modules/examples/JPAFinderExample/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/thesefoolishthings/examples/jpafinderexample/impl/JpaPersonFinder.java} -->

A point that is worth mentioning is about how transactions are handled: it largely depends on the used technology, as one needs to respect the best or
mandatory practices that come with it. In the case of JPA, it is required that the ```Stream``` of results produced by a query is consumed before the
transaction is committed; in our case this means within the call to ```TxManager```.


#[[###]]# Writing an extended ```Finder```

An **extended ```Finder```** is a subclass of ```Finder``` that **exposes additional methods for filtering the results**. For instance we could write a
```PersonFinder``` for the previous ```PersonRegistry``` that extends ```Finder<Person>``` and offers two new methods that filter by first or last name with a
regular expression:

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=new-methods|file=${project.basedir}/../../modules/examples/FinderExample2/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/thesefoolishthings/examples/finderexample2/PersonFinder.java} -->

The registry now would return a ```PersonFinder``` instead of the general ```Finder<Person>```, like this:

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=finder|file=${project.basedir}/../../modules/examples/FinderExample2/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/thesefoolishthings/examples/finderexample2/PersonRegistry2.java} -->

There is a first problem to address: to make it possible to freely mix all the intermediate methods, both the new ones and those defined in the base
```Finder```. This cannot be achieved by merely extending the ```Finder``` interface (i. e. ```interface PersonFinder extends Finder<Person>```), as the
methods declared in ```Finder``` return a value which is statically typed as ```Finder```; so the compiler would not allow to call the new methods. In other
words this would be possible:

```java
    List<Person> persons = findPerson().withLastName("B.*").max(5).results();
```

but this wouldn't compile:

```java
    List<Person> persons = findPerson().max(5).withLastName("B.*").results();
```

Free mixing of methods is mandatory to fulfill the flexibility target that allows a portion of the application to refine a query that has been partially
constructed in another part of the application.

To address this problem a specific interface named ```ExtendedFinderSupport``` is provided. It just re-declares the methods provided by ```Finder``` by
overriding their return value type (in our example to ```PersonFinder``` in place of ```Finder<Person>```). This is possible thanks to the fact that Java features
[covariant return type](https://www.baeldung.com/java-covariant-return-type).

![UML](apidocs/it/tidalwave/util/spi/ExtendedFinderSupport.svg)

```ExtendedFinderSupport``` takes two generics: the type of the managed object (```Person```) and type of the new ```Finder``` (```PersonFinder```). To better
understand this, have a look at the```ExtendedFinderSupport``` source:

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=declaration|file=${project.basedir}//src/main/java/it/tidalwave/util/spi/ExtendedFinderSupport.java} -->

So a properly designed ```PersonFinder``` must extend ```ExtendedFinderSupport<Person, PersonFinder>``` in place of ```Finder<Person>```:

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=person-finder|file=${project.basedir}/../../modules/examples/FinderExample2/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/thesefoolishthings/examples/finderexample2/PersonFinder.java} -->

In this way the new methods can be freely mixed with the existing ones:

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=extended-example|file=${project.basedir}/../../modules/examples/FinderExample2/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/thesefoolishthings/examples/finderexample2/FinderExample2.java} -->


#[[###]]# Writing hierarchic ```Finder```s

In a complex application it might be convenient to write a number of different ```Finder```s in form of a hierarchy, for instance because there is some common behaviour that
can be effectively captured by means of the generalisation-specialisation relationship (even though composition often is a better approach). Since implementing
a ```Finder``` is a matter of respecting the contract declared in its interface, one can proceed as he wishes.
Anyway the API provides a support class
```FinderSupport``` which offers the capability of having a completely encapsulated status: that is with all fields ```private``` (rather than
```protected```) and each level of the hierarchy doesn't know anything of the internal status of the others.
This is a way to mitigate the tight coupling caused by inheritance, so one can make changes to the internal status to a Finder in an intermediate level of
the hierarchy without forcing the subclasses to be adjusted.

![UML](apidocs/it/tidalwave/util/spi/FinderSupport.svg)

To explain how this works by examples, we are going to show how an implementation of the extended ```Finder``` we introduced in the previous section might be
done (in-memory, to keep things simpler).

First we have to declare fields for the internal state and a public constructor to initialize the object with reasonable defaults:

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=public-constructor-and-fields|file=${project.basedir}/../../modules/examples/FinderExample2/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/thesefoolishthings/examples/finderexample2/PersonFinderImpl2.java} -->

A private constructor to initialize everything to arbitrary values is also needed:

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=private-constructor|file=${project.basedir}/../../modules/examples/FinderExample2/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/thesefoolishthings/examples/finderexample2/PersonFinderImpl2.java} -->

As it was explained above, intermediate methods must create copies of the ```Finder``` to comply with the immutability constraint. In a normal class this would be
performed by a copy constructor that takes *all the fields*, including those of the superclass(es); but since we decided to make them ```private``` they can't
be accessed. So all we can do is to call the constructor shown in the above code snippet that only deals with the fields of the current class. Since it calls
the ```super``` default constructor, this means that **the state of the super class(es) will be reset** to a default: i.e. any change applied by intermediate
methods implemented in the super class(es) will be lost. Obviously this is not how things are supposed to work: that's why ```FinderSupport``` offers a
```clonedWithOverride()``` method that fixes everything.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=new-methods|file=${project.basedir}/../../modules/examples/FinderExample2/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/thesefoolishthings/examples/finderexample2/PersonFinderImpl2.java} -->

How does it work? It relies on the the presence of a special copy constructor that looks like this:

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=clone-constructor|file=${project.basedir}/../../modules/examples/FinderExample2/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/thesefoolishthings/examples/finderexample2/PersonFinderImpl2.java} -->

*Note: having this special copy constructor is a requirement of any subclass of ```FinderSupport```. The ```FinderSupport``` constructor makes a runtime check
by introspection and throws an exception if the proper copy constructor is not found.*

It takes two parameters:

1. ```other``` is the usual parameter used in a clone constructor and references the instance being cloned.
2. ```override``` is the incomplete finder we instantiated in our custom intermediate methods. It holds the variations to apply to the state of the new
```Finder```.

We need to initialize all the fields of our pertinence (that is, the ones declared in the current class) choosing from where to get their values. Aren't they
in the ```override``` object? No, they aren't always there. If we are in a hierarchy of ```Finder```s all copy constructors will be called wherever a change
is made; in other words, we aren't sure that our portion of state is the one that needs to be partially changed. We can tell by looking at the dynamic type of
the ```override``` object: if it is our same type, it's the incomplete ```Finder``` with the new values, and we must initialize from it. Otherwise we must
initialize as in a regular clone constructor, from the ```other``` object. A convenience method ```getSource()``` performs the decision for us. Of course we
need to call the ```super()``` constructor to make sure everything is fine (but no details of the super class are exposed by it).

![UML](${project.basedir}/../../modules/examples/FinderExample2/apidocs/it/tidalwave/thesefoolishthings/examples/finderexample2/package.svg)

Is it a bit clumsy? Admittedly it is, even though the code is simple and clean: once the concept is clear, it's easy to write a copy constructor for a new
extended ```Finder```. Part of the clumsiness derives from the complexity of inheritance, that we are trying to work around. If you don't like this approach,
just forget ```FinderSupport```.

Note: if you are perplexed by the concept of “incomplete” ```Finder``` (which is a curious thing indeed, a short-lived object used for a purpose that differs
from its actual purpose, even though it's not far from the PROTOYPE? pattern) you can use a simpler value object just holding the required values. Since
```override``` is a generic ```Object```, it will work. Again, this approach requires some more code to write; but here
[```@Data```](https://projectlombok.org/features/Data) annotation from Lombok or
[Java 16 records](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-spec-experts/2020-July/002254.html) might be useful.*


#[[###]]# Marginal note to ```FinderSupport```

*Note: this part of the API might go away in future.*

If you decide to implement a ```Finder``` by subclassing ```FinderSupport``` there is an alternative way to implement the termination methods, as they have
default implementations. You can rather implement **either** of these two methods:

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=computeNeededResults|file=${project.basedir}/../../modules/Utilities/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/util/spi/FinderSupport.java} -->

This method is responsible **to produce the final results as they will be returned to the caller**. That is it must respect parameters concerning pagination
(```from()``` or ```max()```), sorting and such. For instance, if the source is a relational database this method should prepare and execute a SQL query with
all the relevant clauses (```WHERE```, ```ORDER BY```, ```LIMIT```, etc.). If this method is not overridden, it will call the method shown below and then
apply pagination and sorting by itself (in memory).

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=computeResults|file=${project.basedir}/../../modules/Utilities/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/util/spi/FinderSupport.java} -->

This method would return **all** the objects of pertinence, without filtering or sorting them; the default implementation of ```computeNeededResults()``` will
take care of that. Since this implies to work in memory after having loaded/created all the objects, this approach is easier to write but less efficient. It's
ok for mocks or simple cases. The implementation of our example is:

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=computeResults|file=${project.basedir}/../../modules/examples/FinderExample2/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/thesefoolishthings/examples/finderexample2/PersonFinderImpl2.java} -->



#[[###]]# Comparison with Java 8 ```Stream```

A first look at ```Finder```, in particular the presence of *intermediate* and *termination* methods, sure recalls a similarity with Java 8
[```Stream```](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Stream.html). ```Finder``` was designed before Java 8 existed
and at that time it partly covered functions that were later made available with ```Stream```; but it has been conceived with **a different scope**:

+ ```Stream``` is a **library facility** that focuses on a functional and efficient way to navigate through an abstract sequence of objects; it can be
customised via [```Spliterator```](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Spliterator.html) for integrating to unusual data
sources, but it can't interact with them (as Javadoc clearly says: *«The source cannot be structurally interfered with.»*). More in detail, a ```Spliterator```
doesn't receive from the ```Stream``` information about filtering or sorting. Last but not least, the API has a predefined set of exposed methods that can't be
extended.
+ ```Finder```, instead, is a **business facility** that can interact with the data source and is well aware of the business model; so it can be extended with
new methods that are related to the specific structure of model classes (in the previous example, by knowing that a ```Person``` has ```firstName``` and ```lastName```).

*Furthermore it has been designed to integrate with another member of this library, which is named ```As``` and allows to use a particular implementation
of the DCI architectural pattern.*

A ```Stream``` can filter results by means of function composition: for instance ```filter(p -> Pattern.matches("B.*", p.getFirstName()))```; but in this
case **filtering happens only *after* the objects have been loaded in memory** because the data source has no way to know what is happening and cannot optimise its
behaviour. For instance, if the data source is a DAO to a database, it can't create an ad-hoc SQL statement; ```Finder``` instead can cooperate with
the data source and prepare an optimised query.

```Finder```s can be effectively be used in synergy with ```Stream``` by chaining the appropriated methods: this allows to choose which part of the processing
must be performed by the data source and which part in memory, after data have been retrieved.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=stream-example|file=${project.basedir}/../../modules/examples/FinderExample2/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/thesefoolishthings/examples/finderexample2/FinderExample2.java} -->

This explains why ```Finder``` doesn't offer methods such as ```filter(Predicate<T>)```: because in no way from a compiled Java function it could understand
how to prepare a query for a generic data source. Such a method would be only useful to post-process data once they have been loaded in memory, but it's more
effective to pass the results to a ```Stream``` and use the standard Java API.


#[[##]]# As

[```As```](apidocs/As) is a **factory for providing adapters** (in the meaning of the [Adapter pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern)) of an
object.

*Terminology note: the object for which we are going to create an adapter will be called “datum” and the adapters “roles”. These terms are mutuated from the
[DCI architectural pattern (Data, Context and Interaction)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data,_context_and_interaction), even though ```As``` needn't to be
used in that way. But TheseFoolishThings does provide explicit support for DCI, as will be explained in the relevant chapter.*

Let's start again from a model class, that could be still the ```Person``` entity. In a typical application we might need to display it in a user interface
and to save it to a file, for instance in the XML format. The first point is to decouple ```Person``` from the way we perform those two operations, also to comply
with the [Dependency Inversion principle](https://martinfowler.com/articles/dipInTheWild.html): we want the UI and the XML subsystem to depend on the
abstraction (```Person```), not the opposite way.

We introduce two small interfaces: ```Displayable``` for computing the display name and ```Marshallable``` to serialize an object to an XML stream.

```java
interface Displayable
  {
    String getDisplayName();
  }

interface Marshallable
  {
    void writeTo (Path path)
      throws IOException;
  }
```

These two interfaces are very simple (made of a single method), so they are also in compliance with the Single Responsibility principle and the Interface
Segregation principle.

Having ```Person``` to implement the two interfaces is not an option, because would lead to tight coupling. Working with composition would slightly improve things:

```java
class Person
  {
    public Displayable getDisplayable() { ... }

    public Marshallable getMarshallable() { ... }
  }
```

even though a hardwired implementation of the two interfaces inside ```Person``` would still leave us not too far from the starting point. Introducing a
```RoleFactory``` might be the next step:

```java
class RoleFactory
  {
    public static RoleFactory getInstance() { ... }

    public Displayable createDisplayableFor (Person person) { ... }

    public Marshallable createMarshallableFor (Person person) { ... }
  }

class Person
  {
    public Displayable getDisplayable()
      {
        return RoleFactory.getInstance().createDisplayableFor(this);
      }

    public Marshallable getMarshallable()
      {
        return RoleFactory.getInstance().createMarshallableeFor(this);
      }
  }
```

Since in a real world application we are going to deal with multiple entities, ```RoleFactory``` must be generic:

```java
class RoleFactory
  {
    public static RoleFactory getInstance() { ... }

    public Displayable createDisplayableFor (Object datum) { ... }

    public Marshallable createMarshallableFor (Object datum) { ... }
  }
```

But it's no good to have a fixed, limited set of roles. Who knows what we are going to need in a user interface?

PENDING: Open Close principle?

For instance, a ```Selectable``` role might
be used to execute a task whenever a ```Person``` representation is double-clicked in a UI widget. ```RoleFactory``` can be further generalised as:

```java
class RoleFactory
  {
    public static RoleFactory getInstance() { ... }

    public <T> T createRoleFor (Object datum, Class<T> roleType) { ... }
  }
```

so ```Person``` becomes:

```java
class Person
  {
    public Displayable getDisplayable()
      {
        return RoleFactory.getInstance().createRoleFor(this, Displayable.class);
      }

    public Marshallable getMarshallable()
      {
        return RoleFactory.getInstance().createRoleFor(this, Marshallable.class);
      }
  }
```

But, again, there is still too much coupling involving ```Person```: any new role would require a new method and after all we don't want ```Person``` to depend even on the
```RoleFactory``` infrastructure; it might be a legacy code as well that we can't or don't want to change. Let's move the responsibility of retrieving the
adapter from the adaptee class to the client code that requires the adapter (it does make sense):

```java
class UserInterface
  {
    private final RoleFactory roleFactory = RoleFactory.getInstance();

    public void renderPerson (Person person)
      {
        String displayName = roleFactory.createRoleFor(person, Displayable.class).getDisplayName();
      }
  }
```

So now we are back to the pristine ```Person``` totally unaware of the roles:

```java
class Person
  {
    ...
  }
```

Now the design is good and we can introduce some syntactic sugar. Since the operation might be read like «given a Person treat it **as**
it were a Displayable» we can rename ```createRoleFor()``` to ```as()``` (short names with a proper meaning improve readability) and, with a bit of
rearranging methods and using static imports, get to this code:

```java
import static RoleFactory.as;

class UserInterface
  {
    public void renderPerson (Person person)
      {
        String displayName = as(person, Displayable.class).getDisplayName();
      }
  }
```

If on the other hand we can apply a small change to ```Person``` (the bare minimum), we could think of an interface

```java
interface As
  {
    public <T> T as (Class<T> roleType);
  }
```

and have ```Person``` to implement that interface:

```java
class Person implements As
  {
    ...
  }
```

So we now have another version of our code:

```java
class UserInterface
  {
    public void renderPerson (Person person)
      {
        String displayName = person.as(Displayable.class).getDisplayName();
      }
  }

class Persistence
  {
    public void storePerson (Person person, Path path)
      throws IOException
      {
        person.as(Marshallable.class).writeTo(path);
      }
  }
```

If you got up to here, you have understood what ```As``` is for. Now it's time to deal with implementation details.

Static roles

Most straighy way is to have the detum implement the role interface, even though this is in many case a bad approach; unless the relevant role express a
behaviour that is inherently part of the datum, up to the point that it couldn't been thought of without it. But this seldom happens.

Dynamic roles

Decoupling the datum from the role makes also possible to have alternatives in the implementation of the same role. For instance, Person might be reused
in different applications that need to render it in different ways; inside the same application there might be many ways to render it: for instance with
internationalisation or brief/verbose modalities (full name, only last name, abbreviated first name and last name, etc...). That is the specific implementation
of the same role might depend on a **context**.

Contextual roles

...

The Tell don't Ask principle says that ... It's one of the way we can make our design really strong and RESISTENTE to change. Unfortunately a few people use it
and, if one really wishes to use it, has still to confrontate with a number of frameworks that are designed in an incompatible way (following the getter/setter
pattern). This is typical of persistence frameworks (e.g. JPA), serialisation frameworks (e.g. XYZ) and practically all GUI frameworks.

Roles can be useful in this scenario as they can adapt a business model designed following the TDA principle to an external world that follows other design
strategies.
