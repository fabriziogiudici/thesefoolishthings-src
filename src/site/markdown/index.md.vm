#[[##]]# Introduction

${project.description}

To guess whether the project is in a reasonably stable phase look at it version number: if it contains ALPHA it is undergoing a
wild refactoring (which usually happens when it is updated to a major JDK release). Other than this, most of the Javadoc contains tags:

+ **experimental**: to designate things that are really raw and might go away soon, or perhaps mutate dramatically;
+ **draft**: to designate things that are going to stabilise;
+ **stable**: to designate things with a certain degree of maturity.

In the past Clirr was used to enforce backward compatibility of stable things, but it was dropped after the JDK 8 upgrade. Up to now
it hasn't been replaced by another tool yet. So perhaps at the moment TheseFoolishThings might be of your interest more for inspiration
than for an effective use.

${project.name} is **licensed** with the Apache license.

Since most modules can be used independently, Maven dependency information is available in their specific documentation.

#[[###]]# Sources, issue tracker and continuous integration

The primary source repository is on **[Bitbucket]($context.get("scm.repo.browse.url"))**, a secondary repository (synchronized in real time) is available on
**[GitHub]($context.get("tidalwave.github.browse.url"))**.

To checkout sources from Bitbucket:

```shell
> git clone $context.get("scm.repo.readonly.url")
```

To checkout sources from GitHub:

```shell

```

The issue tracker is hosted on the Atlassian Jira Cloud:

+ ${project.issueManagement.url}

The **continuous integration** is available at:

+ Tidalwave CI server (primary): ${project.ciManagement.url}
+ Travis: https://travis-ci.org/github/tidalwave-it/thesefoolishthings-src
+ Bitbucket pipelines (demonstration only): https://bitbucket.org/tidalwave/thesefoolishthings-src/addon/pipelines/home
